# sql-challenge
The purpose of this challenge was to analyze the employment data of Pewlett Hackard employees that were employed in 1986. An employee data diagram was created with QuickDBD, the sceenshot was saved to show diagramatically, the relationships between the tables created. This data was imported into pgAdmin to create the tables in pgAdmin. The CSV files containing the data  were imported into pgAdmin and a code was created. The code was used to query the data to answer several questions:
1) List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
2) List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
3) List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
